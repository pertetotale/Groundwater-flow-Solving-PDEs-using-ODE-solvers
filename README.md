Groundwater flow â€“ Solving PDEs using ODE solvers Source: 
This work is based on some incomplete course notes using MatLab code and MatLab solvers, which I transposed to python code using scipy solvers.
I also expanded this work by adding code using the Edelman equation, and adding more visualisations.
